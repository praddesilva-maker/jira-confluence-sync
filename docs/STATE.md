# Project State — initiative-sync

_Last updated: 2026-07-05 (post-session-01, CR-002 — no formal session-start/-end cycle run for
this change)_

## Current phase

Phase 0 — Repo + docs skeleton + Forge scaffold. DoD: `docs/delivery/phase-plan.md#phase-0`

## What works right now

- Forge scaffold: `manifest.yml` declares `jira:globalPage` (Custom UI), one `resolver-func`
  function, `storage:app` scope only. App registered (`forge register`) to the `praddesilva-dev`
  Developer Space; real `app.id` is in `manifest.yml`. `forge lint` passes with **no issues**
  (verified after registration, with the user logged in).
- Backend: `src/resolvers/ping.ts` (pure function) + `src/resolvers/index.ts` (Forge `Resolver`
  wiring). Unit-tested (`ping.test.ts` ✔). Handler path in `manifest.yml` is
  `resolvers/index.handler` — Forge always resolves function handlers relative to an implicit
  `src/` root, so the manifest path must **omit** the `src/` prefix (learned the hard way: `index.
  handler` and `src/resolvers/index.handler` both failed `forge lint` with "cannot find associated
  file").
- Frontend: `static/review-ui` (React 18 + Vite, `@forge/bridge`) renders "Initiative Sync —
  Phase 0" and calls `invoke('ping')`, showing the live response. `npm run build` produces
  `static/review-ui/dist` matching the manifest's resource path. Verified locally end-to-end
  (typecheck, lint, test, build all pass) — **not yet verified against a live Atlassian site**,
  since this session had no Atlassian credentials.
- Tooling: Vitest (22 passing tests across `src/` + `scripts/lib/`), ESLint 9 flat config +
  Prettier (root + `static/review-ui`, both clean), `npm run {dev,build,test,lint,typecheck}` at
  root.
- CI: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `check:node`/install/lint/typecheck/test on every PR.
  Production deploy job is present but commented out (needs `FORGE_EMAIL`/`FORGE_API_TOKEN`
  secrets and a `deploy.config.json` strategy — see README).
- **Deploy tooling (CR-002, ADR-005, ADR-006):** `scripts/deploy.mjs` + `scripts/check-node.mjs`,
  both plain Node `.mjs` (no `.sh`/`.ps1`/`.bat` anywhere). Node 22.22.x pinned three ways
  (`.nvmrc`, `package.json` `engines` + `.npmrc` `engine-strict`, `scripts/check-node.mjs`).
  `deploy.config.example.json`/`.env.example` committed; the real `deploy.config.json`/`.env` are
  gitignored (verified: `git check-ignore` confirms both, no secrets in any committed file).
  `npm run deploy:dev` / `deploy:prod` — the latter requires typed `"production"` confirmation
  unless `--yes`. Zero-client-credential model: only the operator's own Forge CLI token is ever
  used; client sites get either automated install (operator has admin) or an installation link
  (operator doesn't) — see README "Client onboarding". Not yet run against a live site by a human
  — like the rest of Phase 0, this needs manual verification.

## In flight / next 1–3 steps

1. **Merge PR #1** (`phase-0/scaffold` → `main`, "Phase 0: scaffold + docs skeleton").
2. **Merge PR #2** (`cr-001/configurable-root`, "CR-001: configurable hierarchy root (docs)")
   after it auto-retargets to `main` once #1 merges — it currently targets `phase-0/scaffold`
   because the docs it edits only existed there.
3. **Merge PR #3** (`cr-002/deploy-tooling`, "CR-002: deploy tooling + environment config") after
   it auto-retargets to `main` once #2 merges — same reason, it branches off `cr-001/configurable-
   root`.
4. **Run Phase 0 manual verification**, either directly or via the new tooling:
   ```bash
   cp deploy.config.example.json deploy.config.json   # fill in your site — see README "Deploying"
   npm run deploy:dev
   # — or, equivalently, the pre-CR-002 direct commands —
   npx --package=@forge/cli forge deploy    # development environment
   npx --package=@forge/cli forge install   # target pradeep-de-silva.atlassian.net
   ```
   Then confirm the global page renders on `pradeep-de-silva.atlassian.net` per
   `docs/delivery/test-notes.md#phase-0` (`forge login`/`forge register` are already done;
   `forge lint` passes clean). Once confirmed, tick the last Phase 0 DoD checkbox in
   `docs/delivery/phase-plan.md` and start Phase 1 with `prompts/phase-1-config.md`.

No code blockers — Phase 1 can start as soon as (4) is confirmed working.

## Known issues / parked

- [#3](https://github.com/praddesilva-maker/jira-confluence-sync/issues/3): GitHub Actions
  deprecation warning (`actions/checkout@v4`/`actions/setup-node@v4` forced onto Node 24). Not
  blocking — CI still passes — parked for a future workflow bump.

## Decisions since last architecture update

- ADR-001: Custom UI on `jira:globalPage` (accepted).
- ADR-002: `asUser()` identity for all product API calls (accepted — pulled forward from the
  original Phase 1 plan; see `prompts/phase-1-config.md` amendment in this same PR).
- ADR-003: Forge LLMs API as primary LLM provider (accepted; renumbered from this phase's original
  prompt, which called it ADR-002 — see PR description for the numbering fix).
- **CR-001 / ADR-004** (docs-only, no code yet): hierarchy root is now configurable per pair
  (`initiative | feature | epic`, CR-001), reversing Q1's hard Jira Premium assumption — `epic` is
  the minimum and needs no Premium levels. Reverses `docs/design/solution-architecture.md` §13 Q1
  in place (marked "Reversed", not deleted, per the ADR append-only convention). `prompts/phase-1-
  config.md` and `docs/delivery/phase-plan.md` (Phases 1–2) are already updated for this — Phase 1
  implementation isn't started yet, so there's no code drift to reconcile.
- **CR-002 / ADR-005 / ADR-006** (`scripts/`, no `manifest.yml` or app runtime changes): real
  deploy/install tooling. ADR-005: all tooling is plain Node `.mjs` invoked via `npm run`, never
  OS-specific shell scripts — Windows and Mac/Linux operators run the same commands. ADR-006: zero
  client credentials anywhere in the model — the only token in play is the operator's own, used
  solely to authenticate the Forge CLI; client-site access comes exclusively from manifest OAuth
  scopes approved once at install, via either an automated install (operator has admin) or an
  installation link (operator doesn't). `deploy.config.json`/`.env` are real-config, gitignored,
  with committed `.example` templates.

## How to run

`npm install && npm --prefix static/review-ui install`, then `npm run typecheck` / `npm run lint`
/ `npm run test` / `npm run build` at the repo root (`npm run check:node` verifies you're on
22.22.x first — all of the above assume that). For live verification: `cp
deploy.config.example.json deploy.config.json` (fill in your site), then `npm run deploy:dev`, per
`docs/delivery/test-notes.md#phase-0`. Test site: `pradeep-de-silva.atlassian.net`.
